# N64Docs

A repository where I try to document everything about the Nintendo 64 to the best of my ability.

All the official and homebrew Nintendo 64 documents, in one place. About time, really.

Only documents that are legal to post will be posted here.

Contributions are very welcome! Please feel free to open issues/PR's and contribute new documents, or update current documents if they have new or updated versions.

TL;DR for the entire README is this is a WIP, and is mostly all sourced from the community and legally available sources. Feedback, constructive criticism, and pull requests/issues are appreciated!

Initially this will have a lot of placeholder information and images. Eventually I hope to take high resolution photographs of everything discussed in this repository, and for all the information to be double and triple-checked for accuracy.

I am also using an "ares-like" approach for the directory structure, but everything is a work-in-progress and suggestions/constructive feedback is always welcome!

Near was a huge inspiration for this, so it made sense to utilize this approach.

Many of the tools used to generate a lot of the information about games are released under various licenses, so check the directory as to which. They are included more as a backup and also a way to give them more exposure. Some of these tools were incredibly valuable for generating some of the information, so huge props to the devs!

This repo isn't much now, but I'll be consistently updating it with new information, images, diagrams, etc. as time goes on. If you'd like to support my work here, or any of my emulation and preservation work, you can do so here:

This isn't required or necessary, I'll keep doing this as long as I am able. I have been unemployed since 2016 and so I do this all in my free time and with my own (very little) money.

But more money helps fund things like dumping tools, more ambitious research endeavors, tools, buying games to dump, etc.
